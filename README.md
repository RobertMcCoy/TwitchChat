# TwitchChat
An attempt at a multi-threaded application that connects to an unlimited number of IRC Channels (Twitch uses IRC for chat) and logs all messages sent on that IRC Channel

# Issues
The main issue is Twitch Rate Limits connections, meaning you will never see all messages, and there is no real way around this hard limit. This application is going to be discontinued and will be rewritten in the near future in .NET Core for much faster interactions (see the top performing languages chart to see why).
